    "# Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your own code(s) to carry out a numerical integration using both the Euler Method and a Runge-Kutta Method (either 2nd order or 4th order).\n",

    "## a\n",

    "Use your code to solve the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and compare your answer with the exact solution $y = \\tan(x)$. Also compare (and show\n",
    "and comment on) your results for both the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods, using the same number of steps for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "## b\n",
    "\n",
    "At what value of x does your numerical solution start to break down, and how does that relate to the derivative of $y(x)$? Use a plot and/or table of numbers to show this breakdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "## c\n",
    "Show that a decrease in step size increases your accuracy. Do you notice a difference in how much the accuracy improves for the Euler method, versus the Runge-Kutta?\n",
    "\n",
    "## d\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretend like you don't know the exact solution to the equation above. Do a convergence study, calculating the fractional difference between your highest-resolution (smallest step- size) case and a few other lower-resolution cases (make a range of step sizes over at least a factor of 10-100). Plot the fractional difference as a function of step size on a log-log scale. Show the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods on the same plot. The slope in this log- log plot is often referred to as the order of convergence. Comment on what you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "## e\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the exact/known solution. Does your smallest fractional difference, between your two highest-resolution cases, well-represent the actual difference between your best solution and the exact solution (i.e., is this a good measure of the uncertainty in your result)?"
